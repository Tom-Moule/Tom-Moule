# Hi there, I'm Tom ðŸ‘‹

### DevOps, Data Science and Machine Learning Enthusiast

## ðŸŒ± My Journey

Having worked in the EdTech sector for over five years, I have gained a deep appreciation of the value that AI and data-centric technologies confer to their users. Fascinated to learn how these technologies work, and how they can be delivered in production, I have developed skills in Python, R, SQL, data science methodologies, statistics, mathematics, machine learning, and DevOps and Cloud platforms in order to transition to more technical roles in these areas


## ðŸ’» My Skills 

- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Computing**: AWS, Azure
- **Tools & Platforms**: Git, GitHub, Bash, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
- **Mathematics**: Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra
- **Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, Distributions, Bootstrapping

## ðŸ”¨ My Top Projects
- **[Titanic Kaggle Competition](https://github.com/Tom-Moule/Titanic-Kaggle-Competition)**: This project encompasses the data exploration/preparation, and model development/evaluation I undertook to submit predictions as part of the kaggle Titanic Competition
- **[DIY Linear Regression](https://github.com/Tom-Moule/DIY-Linear-Regression)**: Here I developed my own Linear Regression models from scratch, and benchmarked them against scikit-learn. The best performing model uses Gradient Descent with Momentum, and has achieves accuracy scores similar to scikit-learn for a wide range of hyperparameters - and does so in a manageable timeframe
- **[DIY K Means Clustering](https://github.com/Tom-Moule/DIY-K-Means-Clustering)**: Here I developed my own K Means Clustering model from scratch. My model achieves almost the same mean squared error as the scikit learn model.
- **[Einstein's Riddle](https://github.com/Tom-Moule/Einsteins-Riddle)**: In this Project, I find a solution to Einstein's Riddle using Python.
