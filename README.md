## ðŸŒ± My Journey

Having worked in the EdTech sector for over five years, I have gained a deep appreciation of the value that AI and data-centric technologies confer to their users. Fascinated to learn how these technologies work, and how they can be delivered in production, I have developed skills in Python, R, SQL, data science methodologies, statistics, mathematics, machine learning, and DevOps and Cloud platforms.


## ðŸ’» My Skills 

- **Languages**: Python, R, SQL
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL
- **Cloud Computing**: Azure
- **Tools & Platforms**: Git, GitHub, Bash, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
- **Mathematics**: Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra
- **Statistics**: Hypothesis testing, Distributions, Bootstrapping

## ðŸ”¨ My Top Projects
- **[Azure DevOps Pipeline](https://github.com/Tom-Moule/Web-App-DevOps-Project)**: In this project I containerise a pre-built python application; provision the infrastructure needed to run the application through an aks cluster; implement a rolling update strategy in the Kubernetes deployment; and design and implement an Azure DevOps build & release pipeline to automate application deployment to AKS.
- **[Titanic Kaggle Competition](https://github.com/Tom-Moule/Titanic-Kaggle-Competition)**: This project encompasses the data exploration/preparation, and model development/evaluation I undertook to submit predictions as part of the kaggle Titanic Competition
- **[DIY Linear Regression](https://github.com/Tom-Moule/DIY-Linear-Regression)**: Here I developed my own Linear Regression models from scratch, and benchmarked them against scikit-learn. The best performing model uses Gradient Descent with Momentum, and has achieves accuracy scores similar to scikit-learn for a wide range of hyperparameters - and does so in a manageable timeframe
- **[DIY K Means Clustering](https://github.com/Tom-Moule/DIY-K-Means-Clustering)**: Here I developed my own K Means Clustering model from scratch. My model achieves almost the same mean squared error as the scikit learn model.
- **[Einstein's Riddle](https://github.com/Tom-Moule/Einsteins-Riddle)**: In this Project, I find a solution to Einstein's Riddle using Python
