## ðŸŒ± My Journey

Having worked in the EdTech sector for over five years, I have gained a deep appreciation of the value that AI and data-centric technologies confer to their users. Fascinated to learn how these technologies work, I have developed skills in Python, R, SQL, data science methodologies, statistics, mathematics, and machine learning, in order to transition to more technical roles in AI.

I am currently completing AiCore's DevOps programme, and intend to combine the skills I am learning with my skills in Machine Learning to become effective at productionaizing machine learning systems.
